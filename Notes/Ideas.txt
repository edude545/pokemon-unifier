Pokemon:

	Deep Sea Pokemon:

		- sea angels. small water/fire type? 400m-600m(midnight zone)
		- another nautilus Pokemon? colourful shell
		- japanese spider crab. crab with extremely long limbs. maybe a bug/water regional/convergent form of spidops? they look similar. 600m
		- relicanth would be around here (700m)
		- oarfish
		- sperm whale pokemon. would be nice to have some freaky deepsea whales that aren't wailord.
		- DEFINITELY a freaky anglerfish. regional form of lanturn (e.g. Abyssal Lanturn)? 1km
		- phronima. tiny translucent buggy things. psychic.
		- blobfish?
		- goblin shark. would have a weird-shaped angular face and protruding jaw.
		- big red jellyfish. very large and opaque.
		- narwhal pokemon. narwhals are cool and they apparently dive to ~1800m, 15 times a day, in search of food.
		- jewel squid. rock/psychic.
		- telescope octopus. another translucent creature. protruding eyes.
		- giant isopod
		- colossal squid
		- barreleye fish. these have translucent heads to help them see better. looks like they're wearing a helmet with a glowing visor or something. 2300m.
		- elephant seals dive this deep. 2400m.
		- squidworm. squid-type body plan with lots of thin, long tendrils. head lined with feathers on both sides. 2700m.
		- scaly-foot snail. eats iron sulphide to make scaly armor plates. pure steel or steel/water.
		- maybe a ghost/water type based on marine snow (debris from dead sea creatures falling downwards).
		- vampire squid. these eat marine snow. 2900m.
		- gulper eel. insane looking lower jaw. 3000m.
		- cosmic jellyfish! 3100m.
		- harp sponge. sound type? 3300m.

		- 3700m is the average depth of the ocean. deeper than this are weird trenches, like the one Alolan Regigigas would probably live in. 4000m is the real-world abyssal zone.
		- dumbo octopus :) 3900m
		- atolla jellyfish. looks like it has a big red eye on the bottom of its face. 4000m.
		- sea pig :) 4500m
		- megamouth shark. 4600m.
		- tripod fish. stands on three little tendrils. 4800m.
		- faceless fish. 5100m.
		- amphipods.
		- 5400m: deepest point of the Manila Trench in the South China Sea.
		- brittle star. 5500m.
		- abyssal spiderfish. 5600m.

		- the Hadal Zone begins at 6000m. more people have been to the moon than below this depth. deepsea trenches form through "subduction", where tectonic plates "meet and push together". this could be the role of Alolan Regigigas: to push apart the tectonic plates and create habitats for deepsea Pokemon.
		- the USS Johnston sand in WWII to a depth of 6200m.
		- grenadier. 6800m.
		- chiton. 6900m.
		- could put some extremely alien stuff down here, because hadal zone life is not well documented, and "almost every expedition uncovers something new".
		- comb jelly. 7200m. translucent jelly with rainbow patterns. existed for 500mil years and are not related to other jellyfish. could reference this by having it be a descendant of ultra beasts?
		- 7400m: deepest point of the Java Trench in the Indian Ocean.
		- hadal snailfish. 8100m.
		- cusk eel. 8400m.
		- 8600m: deepest point of the Puerto Rico Trench.
		- 8800m: height of Mt. Everest.
		- 9200m: "many probes and submarines have been lost trying to reach the deepest parts of the ocean." ghost/steel or ghost/electric type representing a lost drone? abyssal rotom that inhabits broken-down sea equipment or shipwrecks?
		- hadal amphipod. 10300m.
		- 10900m: Challenger Deep.

	For the Abyss, we could have some "ROV" (remotely-operated vehicle) system. These are unmanned submarines designed to do maintenance on underwater structures and observe wildlife. The player could control these to catch/observe deep sea Pokemon in a Safari Zone-type minigame.
